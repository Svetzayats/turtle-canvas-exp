## Turtle graphic 
Simple exercise from "The Pragmatic Programmer" by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas. We need to implement syntactic analysis for commands and I use canvas for drawing. 
- it validate and displays invalid commands from input 
- it drawing by commads p, u, d, n, s, w, e 
- user can clear canvas and start again 
- it doesn't remember previous input and result

**Commands**

<code>p [number from 1 to 8]</code> - pick color 

<code>d</code> - down - lower the pen 

<code>u</code> - up - raise the pen 

<code>n [number]</code> - nord - draw upward 

<code>s [number]</code> - south - draw downward 

<code>w [number]</code> - west - draw to the left 

<code>e [number]</code> - east - draw to the right

**TODO**

[] Add popup with command's instruction.
